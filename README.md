Looking for semantic similarities between textual descriptions of an innovative product ideas and a set of design rules to prototype parts with additive manufacturing. 


Oscar FOSSEY

This code has to be linked we the paper of Oscar Fossey :
Design Rules Extractor for Additive Manufacturability (DREAM)

The code is made of two modules and one text (a test text):

DREAM : The main modul to match design rules and sentences of an idea sheet

similarity_functions :  
modul defining the main NLP function using gensim and stanza:
- preprocessing the text 
- estimating the similarity score
- PDF to text function 
- blocnotes_ to text function
