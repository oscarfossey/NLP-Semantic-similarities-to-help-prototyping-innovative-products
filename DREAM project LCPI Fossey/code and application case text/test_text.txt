This utensil is a circular peeler facilitating the peeling of certain vegetables: Carrots, cucumber, potatoes. The overall structure 
is cylindrical, the size is about 25 cm high, to allow the most classic vegetables to pass through. It consists of: A base on which will 
rest the widest end of the vegetable, composed of sharp spikes on which will be planted the vegetable. A removable cup which will rest on
the base with small holes to let pass the spikes or will come to deposit the peels which one will be able to throw then. A frame made of two 
vertical cylindrical bars and rounded glass panes. A cutting part on which are mounted four spring-loaded steel blades that can be moved with a 
handle. To move this part, the user will have to activate a mechanism that will release the cutting part. A rubber grip mounted on the 
ergonomic glass window to grasp the frame with the other hand. A mechanism that will allow the base to rotate when the cutting part is in 
the down position. The user plants the vegetable on the base of the utensil having taken care to raise the cutting part. He then closes 
the door to work safely. Once the door is closed and the vegetable is in place, he can lower the cutting part. The steel blades being still in 
contact with the vegetable, it is peeled on all its length. Once at the bottom, the base starts to rotate at an angle so that on the 
second pass, the cutting part peels right next to the first. And so on until the entire diameter is peeled. Once peeled, the user opens 
the door to recover the cup with the peelings that he will then throw away. The mechanism used is the association of a rack, two oblique 
toothed wheels and a straight toothed wheel in such a way as to convert a translation movement (that of the cutting part) into a rotation 
movement perpendicular to this axis (movement of the base). Plant the vegetable on small vertical spikes. Move the vegetable back and forth vertically 
without worrying about the rotation of the vegetable as opposed to using a classic peeler. Open the door and retrieve the cup in which the
peelings are grouped, then empty it over the garbage can. Rinse the cup and wipe the steel blades with a sponge. Allow for quick and easy
peeling of the vegetables listed above. Allow for easy and clean disposal of peels. Be safe to use protect the user from spikes and
steel blades. Easy to store. Effortless to use. Easy to clean. Be stable (wide base and anti-slip to avoid breaking the glass).Words on the
